# AutoMap
Strava AutoMap is a tool to dynamically create a map of a run, walk or hike without the need for a GPS device. Users select what hiking trail they performed their activity at(currently only using the Pacific Crest trail but will expand to more trails soon) and provide a few details about the activity. The info filled out by the user is sent to the back-end and a GPX file with time stamps, pace and elevation is created and then uploaded to the users Strava account. This project used CSS, HTML, JavaScript and React.js for the front-end and Python for the back-end. The back-end was hosted on AWS using lambda. GPX activities are uploaded using Strava's API.
