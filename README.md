# AutoMap
Strava AutoMap is a tool to dynamically create a map of a run, walk or hike without the need for a GPS device. Users select what hiking trail they performed their activity at(currently only using the Pacific Crest Trail but will expand to more trails soon) and provide a few details about the activity. The info filled out by the user is sent to the back-end and a GPX file with time stamps, pace and elevation is created and then uploaded to the users Strava account. This project used CSS, HTML, JavaScript and React.js for the front-end and Python for the back-end. The back-end was hosted on AWS using lambda. GPX activities are uploaded using Strava's API.

Currently only allowing permissions for Pacific Crest Trail miles 0-250 while I work on importing correct mile markers.

Test it out at https://danielzfinger.github.io/BaconMaps/

Pacific Crest Trail Miles 251-2650 will be published soon. Colorado Trail and Foothills Trail Maps will be published when I get the time.

If any trail is important for you or you would like me to add please email me danielzanefinger@gmail.com
If I here that someone is wanting a feature or a new trail added that will go to the top of my priority list as opposed to other projects.

If there are any issues or you would like me to add something please email me danielzanefinger@gmail.com 
I would love to hear feedback
